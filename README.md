Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!

First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integrationâ€¦

The AirBnb project entails different parts as described below:
The Console:
	- Here, we will create our data model.
	- We will manage(create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console/command interpreter.
	- We will store and persist objects to a file.
The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between "My object" and "How they are stored and persisted".

Description of the command interpreter:
The command interpreter is started by running the file "console.py"
The command interpreter is used by inputting commands into it
Examples:
None
